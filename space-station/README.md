Simple Journelling game built in Rust.

The genius of journelling games are to provide a structure onto which the imagination of the user can be allowed to run free.

The Game Models a space station lost in space, having lost communication with Earth.
The space station has different sections that require repair from time to time after use.

Each Iteration, User is prompted for their daily log, then prompted to select from a list options, where user can either go to the next day, print the status of the space station components or power down. 

If the user selects "NEW DAY", they are then prompted to select either to repair one of the broken sections of the station or to perform science research (science tends to lead to a section breaking down).
